# Fixing the Lightroom Classic Map Module

As of December 1, 2018, the Map functionality in non-subscription versions of Lightroom stopped working. Adobe [suggests](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/kb/map-view-no-longer-supported.html) buying a subscription to Lightroom CC (USD 120/year) or to copy & paste GPS coordinates into your favorite search engine (LOL!). 

This project resurrects the lost functionality, without subscribing to Lightroom CC.

## Before you proceed: READ THIS FIRST

This procedure requires medium to advanced IT skills. Mistakes may break your installation of Lightroom! If you don't know what you are doing, ask your designated IT support person for help. **We are NOT your IT support person!**

Keep your Google Maps API key secret
- DO NOT SHARE the patched Lightroom module. It contains your personal Google Maps API key!
- DO REMOVE/HIDE the Google Maps API key when discussing  this process, this includes screenshots and videos!

Failing to protect your Google Maps API key may lead to unexpected charges to your Google Cloud account.

**WARRANTY VOID! We are NOT responsible for breaking your Lightroom installation. We are NOT responsible for any charges on your Google Cloud account.**

## Why the Lightroom Map module stopped working

Earlier this year, Google revamped the pricing model for embedding Google Maps into 3rd party applications, changing from free access or flat fees to [transaction based pricing](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/). The number requests to the Google Maps APIs are counted, and after a threshold, a small fee is charged for every request.

Google's new pricing is not compatible with products that are licensed perpetually. With classic Lightroom, Adobe only got money once, but would have to pay Google each time you use the Map module. For Adobe, this is not a sustainable business model.

The Google Maps API key embedded in Adobe Lightroom expired on November 30, 2018.
